# Angmar Roadmap

This is the plan to work towards a future release.

> **NOTE**: this is a "living document" and will be edited over time.

## TODO

- Add inline block for functions as `fun x = 3` -> `fun x { return alfa }`
- Add inline block for expressions as `exp x = alfa` -> `exp x { |> alfa }`
- Add inline block for filters as `filter x = alfa` -> `filter x { |> alfa }`
- Check what is public of the library.
